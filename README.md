# My First Coding Quiz [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) 

## Description
  This project is a simple coding quiz that asks the user five simple coding questions, tracks their score as they answer the questions, and has a time limit of 60 seconds. If a wrong answer is selected, five extra seconds will be subtracted from the timer. When the timer reaches zero, a game over message is shown to the user and they are given the option to refresh the page and begin the quiz again. Further development on this project will include saving user data into locale storage, such as their score and their initials.
